Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends metric and inventory data from your Microsoft SQL Server environment to our platform so you can monitor the health of your Microsoft SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so you can troubleshoot and resolve performance problems.

The easiest way to implement the Microsoft SQL Server integration is in the "Integrations & Agents" section of the New Relic interface. Select the manual step-by-step instructions, if you want to be fully in control over the authentication between the integration and your SQL database, or or use the automated installation, which will create a "newrelic" SQL user and allow it read-only access to your databases. Alternative installations via Ansible and Docker are also available.
